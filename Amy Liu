Person C — Dataset 1: Feature importance & Recommendation

Run L1-LogReg, RFECV, and permutation_importance on best_pipe.

Produce ranking_df with columns: feature, method, rank/score; also an ensemble rank (average of normalized ranks).

Implement accuracy_vs_k_curve using ensemble rank; evaluate k=1..10 via CV; plot.

Write d1_feature_recommendation.txt:

Best CV accuracy

Smallest k within 1% of best

Final feature list in order, plus 2–3 sentence rationale.
Study: RFECV, permutation importance pitfalls (correlated features), CI vs overfitting in wrapper methods.
