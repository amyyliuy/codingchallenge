Dataset 1 report – binary classification and feature selection

The first dataset contains 5,000 materials with 10 numerical descriptors (density, vacancy_content, band_gap, etc.) and a binary label (conductive / non-conductive). There are missing values in all feature columns but none in the label; these are handled by a preprocessing pipeline that performs median imputation followed by standardisation. The classes are imbalanced (about 4,500 non-conductive vs 500 conductive), so a stratified 80/20 train–test split is used to preserve class proportions.

Two classifiers are trained on the full feature set: logistic regression and random forest. Both achieve perfect test performance: accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are all 1.00. The confusion matrices show zero misclassifications: all 99 conductive and 901 non-conductive samples in the test set are assigned the correct class by both models. This indicates that the data are almost perfectly separable in the chosen feature space.

To understand which variables drive this separation, logistic regression coefficients are used as feature importances. The bar plot shows that band_gap has a coefficient magnitude several orders of magnitude larger than any other feature; the remaining features have near-zero weights. This means the decision boundary is essentially a threshold on band_gap alone, which is physically sensible: materials with small or zero band gaps behave as conductors, whereas large band gaps correspond to insulators or semiconductors.

This interpretation is strongly supported by the feature subset experiment. Models are retrained using only the top k features, with k decreasing from 10 down to 1. For every subset size from 10 features all the way down to using only band_gap, the test accuracy remains exactly 1.00. The feature_subset_accuracy curve is therefore a flat line at 1.0. Removing lattice_parameter, mechanical properties and other descriptors does not degrade performance at all; the classifier can still perfectly distinguish conductive from non-conductive samples using band_gap alone.

Overall, dataset 1 behaves like an idealised teaching example: conductivity is almost completely determined by band_gap, other engineered features are redundant for this task, and both linear and nonlinear models can learn a perfect threshold rule. In a real-world setting one would be cautious about such flawless performance (it may suggest synthetic data or hidden leakage), but within this exercise it clearly demonstrates the link between electronic band structure and macroscopic electrical behaviour.
